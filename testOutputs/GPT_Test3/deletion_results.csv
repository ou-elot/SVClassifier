testingData\deletion\p5353bp1Cyce_vs_p53_D_jasmine_177_bamsnap.png,1,"There is a significant drop in coverage in the sample panel but not in the control panel. Soft clipped parts are present near the breakpoints in the sample but not in the control. Additionally, there are numerous red bars flanking the breakpoints in the sample, indicating reads with large insert sizes, which are absent in the control."
testingData\deletion\p5353bp1Cyce_vs_p53_D_jasmine_418_bamsnap.png,0,"There is a coverage drop in both the sample and control panels, which according to the critical rule, classifies the event as false. Although there are red bars indicating large insert size reads in the sample, the presence of coverage drops in both panels overrides other signals."
