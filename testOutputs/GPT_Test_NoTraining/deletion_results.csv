testingData\deletion\p5353bp1Cyce_vs_p53_D_jasmine_177_bamsnap.png,0,"The coverage drop is observed in both the sample and control panels, which according to the critical rule, classifies the event as false regardless of the magnitude of the drop. Additionally, while there are red bars indicating large insert size reads in the sample, the presence of coverage drop in both panels is the decisive factor."
testingData\deletion\p5353bp1Cyce_vs_p53_D_jasmine_418_bamsnap.png,0,"The coverage drop is observed in both the sample and control panels, which according to the critical rule, classifies the event as false. Although there are red bars indicating large insert size reads in the sample, the presence of coverage drop in both panels overrides this signal."
testingData\deletion\p5353bp1Cyce_vs_p53_D_jasmine_435_bamsnap.png,1,"The sample panel shows a significant drop in coverage within the deletion region, while the control panel maintains consistent coverage. There are numerous red bars in the sample panel indicating reads with large insert sizes, which are absent in the control. Soft clipping is observed near the breakpoints in the sample, further supporting the presence of a deletion."
testingData\deletion\p5353bp1Cyce_vs_p53_D_jasmine_462_bamsnap.png,1,"The sample panel shows a significant drop in coverage within the deletion region, which is not present in the control panel. There are numerous red bars indicating reads with large insert sizes in the sample panel, suggesting a deletion event. Soft clipping is observed near the breakpoints in the sample panel, further supporting the presence of a deletion. In contrast, the control panel maintains consistent coverage with fewer red bars and no significant soft clipping near the breakpoints."
testingData\deletion\p53PolqCyce_vs_p53_jasmine_145_bamsnap.png,0,"The coverage drop is observed in both the sample and control panels, which according to the critical rule, classifies the event as false. Although there are red bars indicating large insert size reads in the sample, the presence of a coverage drop in both panels overrides other signals."
testingData\deletion\p53PolqCyce_vs_p53_jasmine_220_bamsnap.png,1,"The sample panel shows a clear drop in coverage within the deletion region, while the control panel maintains consistent coverage. There are soft clipped reads near the breakpoints in the sample, indicating potential breakpoints. Additionally, red bars indicating large insert size reads are present in the sample but not in the control. These observations suggest a true deletion event in the sample."
testingData\deletion\p53PolqCyce_vs_p53_jasmine_269_bamsnap.png,0,"The coverage drop is observed in both the sample and control panels, which according to the critical rule, classifies the event as false. Although there are red bars and soft clipping in the sample panel, the presence of a coverage drop in the control invalidates the deletion signal."
testingData\deletion\p53PolqCyce_vs_p53_jasmine_524_bamsnap.png,0,"The coverage drop is observed in both the sample and control panels, which according to the critical rule, classifies the event as false. Although there are red bars indicating large insert size reads and some soft clipping near the breakpoints in the sample, the presence of a coverage drop in the control invalidates the deletion as a true event."
testingData\deletion\RPEp53brca1_jasmine_124_bamsnap.png,0,"The coverage drop is observed in both the sample and control panels, which according to the critical rule, classifies the event as false. Although there are red bars and soft clipping in the sample, the presence of a similar coverage drop in the control invalidates the deletion signal."
testingData\deletion\RPEp53brca1_jasmine_368_bamsnap.png,0,"The coverage drop is observed in both the sample and control panels, which according to the critical rule, classifies the event as false. Although there are red bars and some soft clipping in the sample, the presence of a similar coverage drop in the control invalidates the deletion signal."
testingData\deletion\RPEp53brca1_jasmine_49_bamsnap.png,1,"The sample panel shows a clear drop in coverage within the deletion region, while the control panel maintains consistent coverage. There are soft clipped reads near the breakpoints in the sample, indicating potential breakpoints. Additionally, red bars are present in the sample panel, suggesting large insert size reads that support the deletion. These signals are absent in the control panel, confirming the deletion as a true event."
testingData\deletion\RPEp53brca1_jasmine_60_bamsnap.png,1,"The sample panel shows a significant drop in coverage within the deletion region, while the control panel maintains consistent coverage. There are red bars indicating large insert size reads flanking the deletion region in the sample, which are absent in the control. Additionally, soft clipping is observed near the breakpoints in the sample, further supporting the presence of a deletion."
testingData\deletion\RPEp53brca1_jasmine_90_bamsnap.png,1,"The sample panel shows a clear drop in coverage within the deletion region, which is not present in the control panel. There are also red bars indicating reads with large insert sizes flanking the deletion region in the sample, but not in the control. Additionally, soft clipping is observed near the breakpoints in the sample, further supporting the presence of a deletion."
