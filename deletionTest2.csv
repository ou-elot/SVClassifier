testingData\deletion\p53PolqCyce_vs_p53_jasmine_145_bamsnap.png,1,"There is a significant drop in coverage in the sample panel that is not present in the control panel. Additionally, there are more soft clipped parts near the breakpoints in the sample compared to the control. The presence of red bars flanking the deletion region in the sample but not in the control further supports the classification of a true deletion event."
testingData\deletion\RPEp53brca1_jasmine_1132_bamsnap.png,1,"There is a strong drop in coverage in the sample panel but not in the control panel. The sample panel shows more soft clipped parts near the breakpoints and a significant presence of red bars flanking the deletion region, which are absent in the control panel."
testingData\deletion\RPEp53brca1_jasmine_124_bamsnap.png,0,"There is a coverage drop in both the sample and control panels. Although the drop is more pronounced in the sample, the critical rule states that if coverage drops occur in both panels, the event is classified as false. Additionally, there are soft clipped parts and red bars present in both panels, indicating similar structural variant signals."
testingData\deletion\RPEp53brca1_jasmine_1537_bamsnap.png,1,"There is a significant drop in coverage in the sample panel that is not present in the control panel. Additionally, there are more soft clipped parts near the breakpoints in the sample compared to the control. The presence of red bars flanking the deletion region in the sample but not in the control further supports the classification of a true deletion event."
testingData\deletion\RPEp53brca1_jasmine_278_bamsnap.png,1,"There is a strong drop in coverage in the sample panel but not in the control panel. The sample panel shows more soft clipped parts near the breakpoints, and there are many red bars flanking the breakpoints in the sample but not in the control."
testingData\deletion\RPEp53brca1_jasmine_324_bamsnap.png,1,"There is a significant drop in coverage in the sample panel that is not present in the control panel. Additionally, there are more soft clipped parts near the breakpoints in the sample compared to the control. The presence of numerous red bars flanking the breakpoints in the sample but not in the control further supports the classification of a true deletion event."
testingData\deletion\RPEp53brca1_jasmine_368_bamsnap.png,1,"There is a strong drop in coverage in the sample panel but not in the control panel. The sample panel shows significant soft clipping near the breakpoints, which is absent in the control. Additionally, there are more red bars flanking the breakpoints in the sample compared to the control, indicating large insert size reads supporting the deletion."
testingData\deletion\RPEp53brca1_jasmine_95_bamsnap.png,1,"There is a significant drop in coverage in the sample panel that is not present in the control panel. Additionally, there are more soft clipped parts near the breakpoints in the sample compared to the control. The presence of red bars flanking the deletion region in the sample but not in the control further supports the classification of a true deletion event."
