testingData\deletion\p5353bp1Cyce_vs_p53_D_jasmine_177_bamsnap.png,1,"There is a strong drop in coverage in the sample panel but not in the control panel. Soft clipped parts are present near the breakpoints in the sample but not in the control. Additionally, there are many red bars flanking the breakpoints in the sample, indicating reads with large insert sizes, which are absent in the control."
testingData\deletion\p5353bp1Cyce_vs_p53_D_jasmine_232_bamsnap.png,1,"There is a significant drop in coverage in the sample panel but not in the control panel. Soft clipped parts are present near the breakpoints in the sample but not in the control. Additionally, there are numerous red bars flanking the breakpoints in the sample, indicating reads with large insert sizes, which are absent in the control."
testingData\deletion\p53PolqCyce_vs_p53_jasmine_116_bamsnap.png,0,"There is a coverage drop in both the sample and control panels, which classifies the event as false according to the critical rule. The presence of red bars and soft clipping is similar in both panels, further supporting the false classification."

Soft clipped parts are observed near the breakpoints in the sample but not in the control. Additionally, there are more red bars flanking the breakpoints in the sample compared to the control, indicating reads with large insert sizes."
